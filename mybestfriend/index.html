                        <p>
						   In 2015 it was me (the dog with the white fur and In those days my name was Solomon) connected to an iron chain 24/7 for the sake of guarding a factory.
							Thanks to one of the posts on Facebook, Dima and his wife Natali saved me from a miserable life and even from death.
							Dima built this site with the intention of helping as many dogs as possible find a warm and loving home like he gave me.
							In Israel there are thousands of dogs that are in associations and kennels just waiting for someone to come and adopt them. On this website you will find links to the websites of all kinds of amazing associations.
							Those associations that save the lives of homeless dogs and cats, they are looking for a new family for them that will give them a second chance at a happy life.
							I hope that through this site many dogs will find new families who can give them a warm and loving home and in return the family will discover what true unconditional love is
							In addition, the same mothers manage to save dogs mainly thanks to the donations of wonderful people. The money from the donations goes to food, medicine, vaccinations and care for the dogs.
							All your donation will give the associations to save more dogs and find them a warm home that will take care of them and love them.</p>

                    <h2>Why is it better to adopt a mixed breed dog?</h2>
                    <div class="accordion-text">
                        <p>It should be noted that the vast majority of dogs in associations are mixed dogs. Many people when looking for a dog would prefer to adopt a purebred dog for all kinds of reasons. Now...don't get me wrong, purebred dogs are amazing dogs and there are good reasons to adopt a purebred dog.
							But here are some of the advantages that you may not have known about why it is better to adopt a mixed dog</p>

								<p><strong>Lifesaving</strong></p>
								<br></br>
                                    <p>Every year in Israel about one hundred thousand dogs are killed because they have not found a home for them.
										As you can imagine, we are not talking about purebred dogs, but mixed dogs, from unwanted or random litters or those that arrived in another way in the pens of animal cruelty and various associations.
										The best solution to this situation is first of all the adoption of dogs from public kennels, when you gain a great, healthy and vaccinated dog, and the dog - which otherwise might be a candidate for euthanasia - gains a loving family and a warm home.</p>

                                    <p>Purebred dogs are exposed to many genetic problems, especially "purebred" dogs without a certificate sold by private individuals. In these cases, the matings are not supervised and may occur between family members, thus leading to diseases and the littering of dogs whose temperament and final character are different from what you were promised. Mixed breed dogs, on the other hand, have stronger immune systems because they do not carry the "breed" genetic diseases and also because they are usually not the product of crossbreeding.</p>

                                    Purebred dogs, which come with an orderly certificate issued by the Israeli Kennel Association, are sold in the range of between one thousand and 10,000 shekels. On the other hand, the adoption basket offered by the various associations will cost you approximately NIS 600 and will include the medical treatment, vaccinations and spaying/neutering. The dog will come to you healthy, vaccinated and spayed/neutered - and you will save precious time and a lot of money.</p>

                                    Bringing a dog into the family has many advantages when it comes to the education of the children. Among other things, the child learns to develop a sense of responsibility, giving and caring for a living and breathing creature, acquires communication and social skills and, of course, enjoys a new joy of life, which fills the house, and endless free love. But the act of adoption is an added value, since the child learns what contribution and help to others is. As parents, you will serve as a role model for your children and teach them an important lesson about humanity and helping those who are weak and alone in the world.</p>

                                    <p><strong>When you give love to a dog, you get it back twice as much.</strong>
                                    <br><br>
                                    It is not for nothing that they say that a dog is man's best friend. In this case you will gain a particularly good friend. Dogs are known for their loyalty to their owners, and as you probably have already learned, attitude leads to attitude and for an abandoned dog - a warm and loving home is not a given. Therefore, when you adopt a dog that is thirsty for warmth and love, you win its loyalty and appreciation - unconditionally.
									<br></br>
									If you are still undecided, know that purebred dogs are in demand, so chances are high that they will find a family. On the other hand, there are far too many mixed-breed dogs with no family, and they are just begging for someone good to come and adopt them. They will win you over - and you will get to go home with a healthy, happy dog with a special character. And yes, you will know that you also saved a life. </p>

                        <p>The Rooftop Association for Living was founded in May 1989 by an amazing woman named the late Ruth Waltshansky. Ruth had a vision to build a shelter for abandoned animals in Holon. We, the successors of her path, did everything to realize the vision and in 2012 we opened the most beautiful and well-invested shelter in Israel.</p>
