	Hello, I'm glad you came to my website, my name is Dima Bershtein and I'm the creator of this website.
	</br>I created this site specifically to gather in one place all the restaurants, cafes and coffee carts in Israel that people recommend the most on the Internet and in Facebook posts.
	</br>On this website you can search for delicious and special places in an easy and convenient way with links to the websites of the place itself.
	</br>In addition, through the site you can send me suggestions for delicious places you know that are not yet on this site and I will add them to the site as soon as possible so that the other visitors to the site can also enjoy it
	</br>Hope you find this site helpful and useful.
